When you brake heavily, the ABS modulates brake pressure so that the wheels continue to rotate instead of locking up. This modulation helps maintain steering ability during an emergency stop, enabling you to maneuver around obstacles if necessary.\n\nWhen the ABS is functioning, you might feel the brake pedal pulsating under your foot; this is normal and indicates that the ABS is active. It's important to note that while ABS helps maintain control, it does not necessarily shorten stopping distances, especially on loose or slippery surfaces. Therefore, driving safely within the prevailing road and weather conditions is crucial.\n\nThe Tiago also features a warning lamp on the dashboard that illuminates momentarily when the ignition is switched on to indicate that the system is operational. If the ABS warning lamp stays on, it indicates a malfunction, and the vehicle should be checked by a TATA MOTORS Authorized Service Centre.\n\n**Citations:**\n- APP-TIAGO-FINAL-OMSB.pdf (Page 21)\n- APP-TIAGO-FINAL-OMSB.pdf (Page 45)", "Passed", 18.84594488143921]]}
