In all cases, it remains the driver\u2019s responsibility to drive within normal safety margins, having due consideration for\\nprevailing weather and traffic conditions.\\nUnder normal braking conditions, ABS will not be activated. However, once the braking force exceeds the available adhesion between the tires and the road surface, thereby causing the wheels to lock, ABS will automatically come into operation.

ABS will ensure that the wheels do not lock and that the car is brought to a halt in the shortest possible distance for the prevailing road surface\\nconditions.\\nNote: On soft surfaces such as powdery snow, sand or gravel, the braking distance produced by the ABS system may be greater than that for a non-ABS system, even improved steering would be experienced. This is because the natural action of locked wheels on soft surfaces is to build up a wedge of material in front of (or to the side of, if steering) the tyre contact patch.

Under normal conditions, the ABS will not activate. However, if the braking force causes the wheels to exceed the available traction on the road surface, the ABS will automatically engage. This system activation can be felt as a rapid pulsation through the brake pedal. It's important to note that ABS is designed to aid in safe braking and should not encourage risky driving behaviors. Even with ABS, it is crucial to drive within safety margins, considering weather and traffic conditions.\n\n**Citations:**\n- Astor Manual.pdf (Page 151)\n- Astor Manual.pdf (Page 152)", "Passed", 6.2493979930877686]]}
