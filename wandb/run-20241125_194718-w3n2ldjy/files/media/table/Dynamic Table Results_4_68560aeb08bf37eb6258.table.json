It emphasizes the importance of checking tyre inflation when cold and the consequences of improper inflation, including comfort issues and uneven wear.

For petrol versions with tire size 175/65 R14, the recommended pressure is 33 psi (2.3 bar) for the front tires and 30 psi (2.1 bar) for the rear tires. For diesel versions, the recommended pressure ranges from 33 to 36 psi (2.3 to 2.5 bar) for the front tires, while maintaining 30 psi (2.1 bar) for the rear tires. It's important to check the tire pressure when the tires are cold to get an accurate reading. Regularly maintaining the correct tire pressure is crucial for optimal riding comfort, handling, fuel efficiency, and tire longevity.\n\n**Citations:**\n- APP-TIAGO-FINAL-OMSB.pdf (Page 113)", "Passed", 5.846612930297852]]}
