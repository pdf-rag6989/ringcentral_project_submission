It categorizes various warning lamps by their description, color, indicator symbol, and remarks. Key components include \"High Coolant Temperature,\" indicated by a red lamp, which signifies that the engine\\'s coolant temperature is excessively high and advises shutting off the engine. The amber \"ABS\" indicator alerts the driver to potential malfunctioning of the Anti-lock Braking System, advising consultation with a service center. Additionally, the \"Low Fuel\" lamp, also amber, illuminates when fuel levels are low, with specific conditions under which the light blinks, indicating an urgent need to refill. The remarks section emphasizes the importance of contacting a TATA MOTORS Authorized Service Centre for any critical issues indicated by the warning lamps. This chart serves as a quick reference for drivers to monitor dashboard alerts, ensuring safety and proper vehicle maintenance. Critical information includes colors and actions required, making it essential for troubleshooting and understanding dashboard functions.'}, {'Document': 'Document 6', 'PDF Name': 'APP-TIAGO-FINAL-OMSB.pdf', 'Page Number': 1, 'Text': 'www.tatatiago.com : | - FROM TATA MOTORS', 'Table JSON': '[]', 'Image Description': \"The image is a cover of the owner's manual for the Tata Tiago, featuring a vibrant orange car prominently displayed.

This system allows the driver to maintain steering control, even in heavy braking situations, which helps in avoiding potential accidents. When ABS is active, you might feel the brake pedal pulsating, which is a normal occurrence. It's important to note that while ABS improves vehicle handling during deceleration, it doesn't substitute for cautious driving. Conditions such as bad roads or adverse weather still require careful driving within safety margins.\n\n**Citations:**\n- APP-TIAGO-FINAL-OMSB.pdf (Page 21)", "Passed", 5.537108898162842]]}
