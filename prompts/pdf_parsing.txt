Analyze the given image from a car manual and provide a detailed description in a continuous text format. The description should include:
1. The type of content in the image (e.g., diagram, instruction, warning sign, specification chart).
2. A detailed description of the main components, labels, or features visible in the image (e.g., engine parts, dashboard controls, tire specifications).
3. Any numerical data or specifications present in the image (e.g., torque values, pressure limits, dimensions, part numbers).
4. Any instructional steps, safety guidelines, or warnings included in the image.
5. The context or purpose of the image (e.g., troubleshooting, installation, maintenance).
6. Key insights or critical information that would be useful for retrieval or understanding.

The output should be in a single paragraph in max 200 words, written in clear and concise language, optimized for embedding in a retrieval system. Also, the focus should be on the image and its relative content, not other text elements.
