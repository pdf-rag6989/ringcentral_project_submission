Astor Manual.pdf,1,Page 1,"MORRIS GARAGES Since 1924 AS TOR INDIA’S FIRST CAR WITH Al INSIDE OWNER'S MANUAL

Image Details:
The image is the cover of an owner's manual for the MG Astor, highlighting the vehicle as ""India's first car with AI inside."" The content type is primarily a promotional graphic rather than a technical document. The silhouette of the car on a dark background emphasizes its sleek design, while the logo and branding information, including ""Morris Garages"" and ""ASTOR,"" are prominently displayed. There are no numerical data, specifications, or detailed components shown in this image, as it serves more of an introductory or marketing purpose. The instructional or safety content typically found in manuals is absent here; instead, the image aims to attract interest in the vehicle. The key insight from this image is its focus on showcasing the car's modern technological features, positioning it as an innovative choice in the automotive market. Overall, this initial presentation sets the tone for what users can expect in the subsequent sections of the owner's manual.

Key components include a graphical illustration of the steering column control with labels indicating multiple switch positions (1, 2, 3, 4). Important numerical data includes the warning that fog lights should only be utilized when visibility is below 100 meters to avoid dazzling other road users. The image outlines specific steps: to engage the front fog lamps, the switch must be turned to position 1 with the side lamps on; for the rear fog lamp, turn to position 2 with the headlamps on. It also includes safety guidelines, warning drivers to avoid dazzling oncoming vehicles when using main beam headlamps.

* Insert the seat belt metal tab into the
corresponding buckle and pull seat belt webbing close to the buckle quickly to
check that the belt clasp locks.
¢ Hold the metal tab and pull the seat belt forward quickly to check that the seat belt reel locks automatically, preventing
the webbing from extending.
° Fully extract the seat belt and visibly examine for twists, fraying, splits or worn
areas.
° Fully extract the seat belt and allow to return slowly to ensure continual and
complete smooth operation.
* Visibly examine the seat belt for missing
or broken components.
¢ Ensure the seat belt warning system is
fully functional.

Image Details:
The image from the car manual features instructional content related to the vehicle's keyless entry system, indicating both locking and unlocking procedures. It includes a diagram illustrating the door handle button's function. The main components detailed are the keyless locking mechanism, which requires pressing the door handle button after switching the START/STOP switch to the OFF position, and the keyless unlocking process, where a single press on the handle unlocks the vehicle. Numerical data includes a note that if no action is taken after unlocking, the vehicle will automatically re-lock in 30 seconds for security. Safety guidelines emphasize ensuring all doors are closed before locking, as failure to do so will trigger a horn signal indicating a mislock condition. The purpose of the image guides users on vehicle security features, ensuring proper operation of the locking system. Key insights involve understanding the automatic re-lock function and the implications of mislock, emphasizing the importance of confirming all doors are properly closed before arming the alarm system.

brakes becoming overheated.
This will cause a reduction in braking performance and may
even result in brake failure.
If driving down a hill for long distances, it is advised to move the gear shift lever to the right and select the Manual mode. This allows manual gear selection. Use a lower gear selection to aid the slowing of the vehicle
and thus avoiding over-use of the brakes.
If a threshold is reached, the vehicle will automatically shift up, in these cases use of the brakes to slow the vehicle is necessary, at
the same time re-select the lower gear.
P Gear Emergency Release When the START/STOP Switch is on and the brake pedal is pressed, if the shift lever cannot be moved out of P gear, turn off the START/ STOP Switch, and apply the EPB.

out of control.
With D or S gear selected, pressing the accelerator pedal all the way down in one motion (also known as_ kick-down) will provide better acceleration performance during overtaking.

If driving down a hill for long distances, slow down first, and then push the shift lever from D gear to the right and enter into manual mode, then manually engage in low gear. Use a lower gear selection to aid the slowing of the vehicle and thus avoiding over-use of the brakes. For example, when driving down the hill with continuous curves, engage into 2 gear; when driving down the straight hill, engage into 3 gear. If the brake force of engine is insufficient, the speed is increased, the automatic transmission will shift to high gear automatically to avoid the overrunning of the engine, at this time, you need to press the brake pedal immediately and shift to

A Whilst using the car following cruise function it is strongly recommended that the driver does not touch the accelerator pedal. Any activation of the accelerator will not allow the system to automatically apply the brakes should this be
necessary.
DO NOT exit the vehicle when the adaptive cruise control system car following cruise function has stopped the car, or is keeping the car stationary. Before exiting the",['images/Astor Manual/page-158/full_page_image.png'],images/Astor Manual/page-158/full_page_image.png,[],,[],

maximum speed sign).
Some drastic or rapid steering operations made by the driver may be judged as changing lane or turning around at an intersection by the system. This will result in the identified
speed limit signs being cleared.
168 Lane Assist System A The lane assist system is an auxiliary system that provides assistance to the driver. It does NOT remove the responsibility
of safe driving from the driver.
When choosing to use the lane assist system, the driver MUST always pay attention to the surroundings, hold the steering wheel and be prepared to make manoeuvres at any time. Failure to maintain overall control of the vehicle may result in an
accident or personal injury.

Image Details:
The image contains a diagram and instructional content related to the Active Speed Limit (ASL) system of a vehicle. It features a labeled lever switch located to the left of the steering wheel, indicating various functions: Speed Limit Increase (1), Speed Limit Decrease (2), ASL Standby (3), Cruise Standby (4), and Set (5). The ASL system is designed to keep the vehicle speed below a user-set limit, with the target speed displayed in the instrument cluster. Specifications include a speed adjustment range of 30 to 200 km/h, with increments of 5 km/h when the lever is adjusted. The image describes operational steps: activating the ASL by pressing the Set button, how to adjust the target speed, and conditions under which the vehicle will slow to the set limit. Safety guidelines emphasize that when the accelerator pedal is fully pressed, it overrides the set limit temporarily. The context of the image is to guide users on operating and suspending the ASL system, providing critical insights for maintaining desired speed regulation while driving.

","The ASL system shares the same lever switch as the cruise control system, located to the left of the steering wheel below the indicator stalk. The switch can be toggled between both functions, however only one function can operate at any one time.

### Activate

The desired target speed of the ASL system is displayed in the instrument information clutter.

With the START/STOP Switch in position ON/RUNNING and the lever switch in ""ASL Standby"" (3 in figure), the ASL function is in standby mode. Presenting the ""Set"" button (5 in figure) will activate the ASL system. When activated and vehicle speed is less than or equal to 30 km/h, then the target speed limit value will be set at 30 km/h by default. When activated and vehicle speed is higher than 30 km/h, then the current vehicle speed will be set as the target speed limit value. Firstly, the target speed limit value will be rounded when the lever switch is moved upwards or downwards. Then, the target speed limit value will be increased or decreased by 5 km/h every time the lever switch is briefly moved upwards or downwards. Hove the lever upwards or downwards and hold, the target speed limit value will change continuously in units of 3km/h. The range of target speed adjustment is 30 - 200km/h.

### When activated if the vehicle speed is greater than the user inputted target speed the system will begin to slow the vehicle to the inputted target.

#### When ASL is active, pressed the accelerator pedal fully (eg: overtaking) can make the vehicle speed increased. When released the pedal, vehicle speed will subject to the target speed limit value.

#### Suspend ASL

When ASL is active, to suspend the feature press the ""Set"" button (5 in figure) and the ASL system will exit to the standby state.

","### Fuse Replacement

#### Fuse

Fuses are simple circuit breakers which protect the vehicle electrical equipment by preventing the electrical circuits from being overloaded. A blown fuse indicates that the item of electrical equipment it protects stops working.

Check a suspect fuse by removing it from the fuse box and looking for a break in the wire in the fuse.

It is recommended to have spare fuses in the vehicle, which can be obtained from a local MG Authorised Dealer.

\[\frac{\text{IMPORTANT}}{\text{NEVER}}\]

NEVER attempt to repair a blown fuse. ALWAYS replace a fuse with one of the same rating.

If a replaced fuse fails immediately, please contact an MG Authorised Dealer as soon as possible.

The image is a cover of the owner's manual for the Tata Tiago, featuring a vibrant orange car prominently displayed. This cover serves primarily as an introduction to the manual, outlining essential vehicle information. The main components visible include the car's sleek design with notable features such as modern headlights, alloy wheels, and a distinctive front grille. The manual likely contains critical specifications, such as engine details, fuel capacity, and maintenance intervals. While specific numerical data isn’t provided in the image, it typically includes torque values and other performance metrics in the manual. There may also be instructional steps for usage and maintenance, alongside safety guidelines relevant to operating the vehicle. The context of this image is to inform new owners about the features, specifications, and upkeep of their Tata Tiago, ensuring they understand their vehicle's capabilities and maintenance requirements from the outset. Key insights would include the importance of following the manual for optimal vehicle performance and safety.

Image Details:
The image appears to be the cover of the Tata Tiago owner's manual, indicating it contains important information for vehicle owners. The content type is primarily informative, designed to guide users in operating, maintaining, and troubleshooting the Tata Tiago. The main feature is a side view illustration of the Tata Tiago vehicle, clearly branded with ""TATA"" at the top. The manual is presumably structured to cover various aspects of vehicle care, including sections on dashboard controls, maintenance schedules, and safety features. Although no specific numerical data, specifications, or instructional steps are visible in the image, such information is typically included in owner manuals for aspects like tire pressures, engine specifications, or maintenance intervals. The context of the image suggests it serves as a reference for understanding the car’s features and ensuring proper maintenance practices. Key insights for users would include the need to consult this manual for details on vehicle operation and safety guidelines to enhance their ownership experience.

Safety consciousness not only ensures your safety and the safety of other road users, but it also helps to reduce the wear and tear on your vehicle.

### Safe driving depends on:

* How quickly you make decisions to avoid an accident.
* Your ability to concentrate.
* How well you can see and judge objects.
* How well familiar you are with your vehicle controls and its capabilities.

### Not:

* _Fatigue is a result of physical or mental exertion that impairs judgment. Driver fatigue may be due to inadequate sleep, extended work hours, strenuous work or non-work activities or combination of other factors. Take rest at regular intervals._

### Safety Tips

* Always take into account the road conditions, weather conditions, vehicle speed in order to prevent accidents.
* Turn 'ON' the side indicators at least 30 meters before taking a turn or changing the lane.
* Decelerate to a safe speed before taking turn. Do not apply brakes during comering.
* When overtaking other vehicles, watch out for the oncoming vehicle.
* Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
* If your vehicle is equipped with infotainment/navigation system, set and make changes to your travel route only when the vehicle is parked.
* Program radio presets with the vehicle parked, and use your programmed presets to make radio use quicker and simpler.","Important Information In this Owner's Manual, you will find the text under the heading “WARNING” and “NOTE” which highlights important infor- mation.

### Seat Belts

Seat-belt is a safety device designed to secure the occupant travelling in the vehicle. TATA MOTORS strongly recommends that all the occupants should always wear seat belts while travelling, irrespective of journey duration.

In normal driving, the belt lets you move freely in your seat. In case of an accident or sudden braking, inertia reel automatically tightens the belt to help restrain your body.

### Importance of wearing seat belt

* Reduces the risk of being thrown inside the vehicle in case of a collision/sudden braking.
* It will help to keep you in the proper position when the air bag inflates.
* Reduces the risk of harm in frontal/angular collisions that are not enough to activate the air bag.
* Reduces the risk of harm in rollover, side or rear impact collisions.

there is any fault in the system.
Take your vehicle to the nearest TATA MOTORS Authorised service
station if the symbol starts blinking.
Temperature Gauge (if equipped) When the ignition switch is in the “ON” position, this gauge indicates the engine coolant temperature. The _ indicator should stay within the normal, accepta- ble temperature range between “H” and “C”. If the indicator approaches “H”,
overheating is indicated by red LED bar.
If the coolant temperature reading is very high, the warning tell-tale flashes with an audible buzzer. In this case, stop the vehicle, switch ‘OFF’ the engine and cool it down for some time. Contact a nearest TATA MOTORS Authorised Ser-
vice Centre immediately for rectification.
DASHBOARD AND FEATURES The red LED bar and high coolant temperature warning tell-tale indi- cates overheating that may damage the engine. Continuing to drive the vehicle when engine overheating is indicated can result in severe engine
damage or fire.

116 On Board Diagnostic (OBD Il) System On board Diagnostics or OBD is an auto- motive term referring to a vehicle’s self- diagnostic and reporting capability. The OBD system allows continuous diagno- sis of the components of the vehicle cor- related with emissions. This system warns the driver, by turning “ON” the Malfunction Indication lamp (MIL) on the instrument cluster, when a fault causes
emission levels to increase.
The OBD system also has a diagnostic connector that can be interfaced with appropriate diagnostic tools, which makes it possible to read the fault codes stored in the Electronic Control Unit, to- gether with a series of specific parame-
ters for Engine operation and Diagnosis.
This check can also be carried out by the
traffic police.
To access the diagnostic connector, open the fuse box cover which is located on RH side below the steering wheel. Re- fer ‘Emergency and Breakdown Assis-
tance’ section for removal of cover.

The image depicts a combination of instructional content and a diagram related to vehicle maintenance and the On Board Diagnostic (OBD II) system. It outlines steps for battery replacement in the key fob, emphasizing the proper orientation of the battery indicated by a ""+"" symbol and instructing users to press the battery cover until it clicks into place. It includes a note specifying the use of a CR 2032 battery. The OBD II system description explains its role in vehicle diagnostics, mentioning the Malfunction Indication Lamp (MIL) activation for emissions-related issues. Key features include the diagnostic connector's location, which is accessible by opening the fuse box cover on the right-hand side beneath the steering wheel. There are no specific numerical data or torque values presented in this image. The purpose is to guide users through maintaining their vehicle’s key fob battery and understanding the OBD system for efficient diagnostics. Critical information includes the battery specification and the diagnostic connector access for troubleshooting purposes.

These conditions demand regular care of the vehicle body. Dirt, in- sects, bird droppings, oil, grease, fuel and stone chippings should be removed
as soon as possible.
Washing Following these tips while washing your
vehicle.
Hand wash: 1. Always wash your vehicle in shade and
the surface is at room temperature.
2. Wash with mild vehicle wash soap like ‘Car Shampoo’ and use a soft bristle brush, sponge or soft cloth and rinse it frequently while washing to avoid
scratches.
CAR CARE AND VALUE ADDED SERVICES 3. To avoid scratches, please wear soft gloves. Remove finger rings, nails, wrist
watch while washing.
4. To remove stubborn stains and con- taminants like tar, use turpentine or cleaners like ‘Stain remover’ which are
safe for paint surfaces.
5. Avoid substances like petrol, diesel, kerosene, benzene, thinner or other sol-
vents that cause damage to paint.
6. Dry your vehicle thoroughly to prevent
any damp spots.
7. Rinse all surfaces thoroughly to pre- vent any traces of soap and other clean- ers as this may lead to the formation of
stains on the painted surface later.
Do not direct high pressure washer fluid/ water jets (Pressure above 0.5 Bar) at electrical devices and con- necter during washing. This is to pre- vent malfunction / failure of electri-
cal system due to water ingress.
After drying the vehicle, inspect it for chips and scratches that could allow cor- rosion to start. Apply touch up paint
where necessary.
Cleaning of Carpets Vacuum clean the carpet regularly to re- move dirt. Dirt will make the carpet wear out faster. Periodically shampoo the car-
pet to keep it looking new.
Use carpet cleaners (preferably foam type). Follow the instructions that come with the cleaner. Apply it with a sponge or soft brush. Keep the carpeting as dry as possible by not adding water to the
foam.
NOTE Avoid wiping of painted surface in dry condition as it may leave
scratches on the painted surface.

It outlines the accumulation of carbon deposits in various engine components, including the injector pump, fuel injectors, combustion chambers, and intake valves, which can lead to issues like rough idling, decreased power, and increased emissions. Key components of the de-carbonization process are highlighted, such as cleaning fuel injectors, throttle body, plenum, and air intake, as well as removing combustion chamber deposits. The described outcomes of this process include improved fuel economy, enhanced engine performance, smoother starts, and reduced emissions. Additionally, it emphasizes the benefit of reduced wear on injectors and pumps, ultimately leading to cost savings in maintenance. The image also specifies its approval for use with low sulfur diesel fuel and EGR-equipped diesel engines. Overall, this content serves the purpose of promoting a maintenance service aimed at improving diesel engine efficiency and longevity.",[],
