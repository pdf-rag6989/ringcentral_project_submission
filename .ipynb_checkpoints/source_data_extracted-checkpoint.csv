It includes several gauges: the speedometer (1) that displays vehicle speed in km/h, the tachometer (2) that indicates engine speed in thousands of RPM, the engine coolant temperature gauge (3), and a fuel gauge (4) showing the quantity of fuel in the tank. The fuel gauge features an important warning about low fuel, indicating that a yellow light will illuminate or flash when the fuel level is low, urging users to refuel promptly. There are safety guidelines stressing to avoid prolonged periods in the red sector of the tachometer to protect the engine from damage. Additionally, it notes the location of the fuel filler on the right side of the vehicle. This diagram serves as a guide for monitoring key vehicle metrics for safe operation and maintenance. Critical insights include the necessity of refueling when the low fuel warning appears and the importance of engine speed management.",[],

It includes key components such as the ""Range To Empty,"" ""Gear Display,"" ""Total Mileage,"" and ""General Information,"" which are labeled numerically. The ""Range To Empty"" feature indicates estimated mileage before fuel depletion, while the ""Gear Display"" shows the current gear position (P, R, N, D, S, 1-8) and signals potential faults with “EP.” Total mileage refers to the cumulative distance driven. Instructions are provided for using steering wheel controls: pressing UP/DOWN adjusts information display, and the OK button confirms or resets selections. The context of the image is maintenance and operational guidance, assisting users in understanding dashboard functions. Critical information includes the significance of gear indicators for safe driving and the importance of monitoring fuel range to avoid running out of gas.",[],
