2024-11-25 16:51:27,156 [INFO] The prompt is Extract the specified fields and return them strictly in the following JSON format. Ensure all constraints are followed exactly.

Fields to Extract:
car_model_name: Match the car model from this list: {}. If no match is found, set the value to null.
image_url: Extract the URL if present. If no URL is found, set the value to null.
text_or_image_search:
Analyze the input query to determine if the search is based on an image or text.
If the query indicates an image search (e.g., mentions "image" or includes a visual description), set the value to "image".
Additionally, check if a valid image_url exists. If present, set the value to "image".
If neither condition applies, set the value to "text".

Input:
{}

Output:
The output must strictly follow this JSON format:
{
    "car_model_name": "Tesla Model S",
    "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "text_or_image_search": "image"
}

Constraints:
Output JSON Structure: The output must include all three keys: car_model_name, image_url, and text_or_image_search, regardless of whether their values are null or not.
Field Values:
car_model_name: Must match exactly from the provided list or be null if no match is found.
image_url: Must be a valid URL or null.
text_or_image_search: Must be "image" if a valid image_url exists, otherwise "text".
No Additional Fields: Do not include any fields other than car_model_name, image_url, and text_or_image_search.
Strict Format Compliance: Ensure the JSON output matches the provided example format exactly in terms of structure and data types.
